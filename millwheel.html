					<h1>Reading of MillWheel</h1>
					<p>
						These are some notes I made while reading <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41378.pdf">MillWheel: Fault-Tolerant Stream Processing at
						Internet Scale</a>
					</p>
					<h3>Idea Highlights</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Exactly once delivery of a record is non-trivial. If MillWheel can guarantee it, then it means processing become a lot easier.
						</li>
						<li>
							"Hinges upon its ability to take non-idempotent user code and run it as it were idempotent." Although, if the user write idempotent code, then we can relax the restrictions and the system will perform significantly faster.
						</li>
						<li>
							Dynamically add and remove computations from the topology.
						</li>
						<li>
							Persistent state, to hide things like failures and changing machines.
						</li>
						<li>
							The API is fairly limited, so it can have stronger guarantees on the systems capability.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Notes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							1. Introduction
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								The idea is to think of your computation process as a directed compute graph.
							</li>
							<li>
								Record delivery uses at least once semantics, idempotent record processing means that the user will see exactly once semantics.
							</li>
							<li>
								Focusing on fault tolerance, versatility, and scalability.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> and Sonora do not have enough operators. Spark SQL makes the semantics of calculations too strict.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/s4/">S4</a> isn't as fault tolerant, which I think is not as true for newer releases.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="http://storm.incubator.apache.org/">Storm</a>'s Trident isn't as versatile because it requires strict transactional ordering.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							2. Motivations and Requirements
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								For use with Zeitgeist, which provides "Hot Trends".
							</li>
							<li>
								One second buckets, compare with models and a trend is when a non-trivial number of time buckets indicate the same anomaly.
							</li>
							<li>
								Uses a low watermark (implemented with counters) to indicate that all messages up to a given timestamp has been delivered for a particular stage. This allows differentiation between missing data and non-existent data.
							</li>
							<li>
								Exactly-once processing is required, so MillWheel de-duplicates records for you.
							</li>
							<li>
								One requirement is to publish data to consumer as soon as possible, does no batching mean a performance hit?
							</li>
						</ul>

						<li>
							3. System Overview
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								(key, value, timestamp) triples
							</li>
							<li>
								Can add and remove computations from a topology without restarting? Is it similar to a migration using a feature flag?
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							4. Core Concepts
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Consumer defines a key extraction function for each record.
							</li>
							<li>
								Computation has 0 or more input streams and 1 or more output streams.
							</li>
							<li>
								Streams are defined only by name.
							</li>
							<li>
								Persistent state can be preserved for things like counters and joins.
							</li>
							<li>
								Low watermark of A = min(oldest A, low watermark of C : C outputs to A)
							</li>
							<li>
								Late arriving data is simply dropped. Low threshold is fine, but does the system self adjust when the amount of late arriving data starts climbing?
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							5. API
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								ProcessRecord, ProcessTimer, SetTimer, ProduceRecord, MutablePersistentState
							</li>
							<li>
								Use injectors to bring external data into system. i.e. ingestion of log files.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							6. Fault Tolerance
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								"Hinges upon its ability to take non-idempotent user code and run it as it were idempotent."
							</li>
							<li>
								Exactly-once delivery: Retry messages until Acked (at least once), and then deduplicate. Is a bloom filter and an <a href="https://github.com/jmhodges/opposite_of_a_bloom_filter">opposite of a bloom filter</a> together maybe a better solution?
							</li>
							<li>
								Can disable deduplication if the user's operations are idempotent already.
							</li>
							<li>
								Strong Production = check pointing into persistent storage before delivery.
							</li>
							<li>
								Weak Production = broadcast deliveries optimistically downstream, before persisting. Failures are protected by replays.
							</li>
							<li>
								Sequencer token to each write to avoid zombie writers persisting stale information.
							</li>
							<li>
								Dedupe record -> compute -> commit/persist -> ACK -> downstream
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							7. System Implementations
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Streams delivered via RPC (Protocol Buffers?).
							</li>
							<li>
								Sounds like it's running on top of Borg. Is it as an isolated resource?
							</li>
							<li>
								Central authority to keep track of all low watermarks. Consumers then subscribe to interested low watermarks.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<li>
							8. Evaluation
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								There was framework-level caching because the use case is different from common use cases. i.e. LRU is not great for this situation.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
